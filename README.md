# 📦 Three.js Class Project

This repository contains the code from our **Three.js + React + Vite** class session.

In this class, we learned what **Three.js** is, how it works with **React**, and how to create a basic 3D scene using **@react-three/fiber (R3F)** and **@react-three/drei**. We also created a simple rotating 3D box.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **React** – UI library
* **Vite** – Fast build tool
* **Three.js** – Core 3D graphics library (WebGL)
* **@react-three/fiber (R3F)** – React renderer for Three.js
* **@react-three/drei** – Helper components for R3F

---

## 🧠 What We Covered in Class

In today’s class, we covered the following topics:

* What **Three.js** is and why it is used for 3D graphics on the web
* Creating a **React + Vite** project
* Installing Three.js related libraries
* Understanding **React Three Fiber (R3F)**
* Using **Drei** helper components
* Creating a basic 3D scene
* Adding a **box geometry**
* Rotating the box using animation

---

## 📦 Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryamani752/three.js-class.git
```

Go inside the project folder:

```bash
cd three.js-class
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Installed main libraries:

## ▶️ Run the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and you should see a **rotating 3D box** rendered using Three.js.

## 🔄 Rotating Box Explanation

We used **React Three Fiber** to animate the box:

* `<Canvas>` is used to create the 3D scene
* `<mesh>` is used to create the box
* The box rotates smoothly using frame-based animation


## 📝 Notes

* This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to Three.js with React
* You can extend this by adding lights, camera controls, textures, and 3D models
* Perfect starting point for learning **3D web development**

## 🙌 Conclusion

This repository represents what we learned in today’s Three.js class.

Keep practicing and experimenting with 3D scenes 🚀

Happy Coding! 💙
